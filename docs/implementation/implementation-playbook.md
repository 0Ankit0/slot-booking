# Implementation Playbook

## 1. Delivery Goal
Ship a production-ready system for **real-time slot discovery, booking, payment, cancellation, and notifications**.

### Target KPIs
- Booking success > 99%, Slot lock race failures < 0.1%, API p95 < 200ms
- Availability target: 99.9%
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): < 30 minutes

## 2. Implementation Scope (Must-Have)
Core services to implement:
- Availability, Booking, Payment, Notification, Provider Management
- Admin and operator console
- Monitoring, alerting, and audit logging
- Security controls (authentication, authorization, encryption)

## 3. Environment Setup
### Local
1. Install runtime dependencies as listed in `implementation/code-guidelines.md` (or `implementation/implementation-guidelines.md`).
2. Start required infrastructure (DB, cache, queue, search, object store) using Docker Compose.
3. Configure `.env` with local credentials and feature flags.
4. Seed baseline data for development and demo scenarios.

### Non-Production / Production
1. Provision cloud resources from `infrastructure/cloud-architecture.md`.
2. Configure network, subnets, WAF, and private endpoints from `infrastructure/network-infrastructure.md`.
3. Deploy workloads according to `infrastructure/deployment-diagram.md`.
4. Enable centralized logs, metrics, and traces.

## 4. Build Plan by Workstream
### A) Backend APIs
- Implement all endpoints from `detailed-design/api-design.md`.
- Add request/response validation, idempotency, pagination, filtering, and error contracts.
- Add retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts for downstream dependencies.

### B) Data Layer
- Implement schema from `detailed-design/erd-database-schema.md`.
- Add migrations and rollback scripts.
- Add indexes for read-heavy and write-heavy paths.
- Define retention and archival policies.

### C) Domain Logic
- Implement lifecycle and transitions from `detailed-design/state-machine-diagram.md`.
- Implement orchestration from `detailed-design/sequence-diagram.md` (or equivalent diagrams).
- Enforce all rules from `analysis/business-rules.md`.

### D) Frontend / Consumer Integration
- Implement consumer journeys from `analysis/use-case-descriptions.md` and `analysis/activity-diagram.md` (or equivalent).
- Add optimistic UI states, loading states, and error states.
- Add accessibility and localization support where applicable.

### E) Security & Compliance
- Enforce least-privilege IAM and role-based access control.
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.
- Add audit trails for privileged and business-critical operations.
- Implement controls from `edge-cases/security-and-compliance.md`.

### F) Reliability & Operations
- Implement operational safeguards from `edge-cases/operations.md`.
- Add SLO dashboards and alerting thresholds.
- Add runbooks for incident triage and service restoration.

## 5. Testing Strategy (Release Blocking)
- Unit tests for domain logic and adapters.
- Integration tests for DB/cache/queue/external provider integrations.
- API contract tests for all public endpoints.
- End-to-end tests for top business flows and edge-cases.
- Load and stress tests aligned with documented performance targets.
- Security tests: authz/authn checks, OWASP top risks, secrets scanning.

## 6. Data & Migration Readiness
- Initial seed strategy and synthetic data generation.
- Backfill and replay strategy for historical data.
- Zero-downtime migration approach (expand-and-contract).
- Verified restore drills for backups.

## 7. CI/CD & Release Management
- CI gates: lint, type checks, unit tests, integration tests, SAST.
- Build immutable artifacts and sign releases.
- Progressive rollout: canary/blue-green with automatic rollback.
- Post-deploy smoke tests and synthetic monitoring.

## 8. Go-Live Readiness Checklist
- [ ] All required APIs implemented and contract-validated.
- [ ] Database migrations verified in staging.
- [ ] Critical edge-cases validated from `edge-cases/` docs.
- [ ] On-call rotation, escalation matrix, and runbooks active.
- [ ] Backups and restore tested successfully.
- [ ] Security review and threat model sign-off completed.
- [ ] Performance/load targets achieved in pre-production.
- [ ] Observability dashboards and alerts operational.

## 9. Handover Artifacts
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API collections and schema definitions
- Operational runbooks and incident playbooks
- Environment variable catalog and secrets ownership
- Release checklist and rollback SOP

## 10. Definition of Done
System is considered implementation-ready and production-capable when:
1. Functional and non-functional requirements are traceable to tests.
2. All critical paths and edge-cases have automated test coverage.
3. Deployment and rollback are fully automated and repeatable.
4. Security, reliability, and operational controls are verified in staging.
5. Stakeholders sign off on KPI and acceptance criteria.
