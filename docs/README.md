# Slot Booking System

> **Production-Grade, Multi-Domain Time-Slot Reservation Platform**

A fully-documented, implementation-ready design for a generalized slot and time-block booking engine supporting sports courts, meeting rooms, medical appointments, salon services, studio time, parking, and any other resource that operates on scheduled availability windows.

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Resource & Venue Management** | Define courts, rooms, studios, seats, or any bookable asset with capacity, pricing tiers, and operating hours |
| **Flexible Slot Configuration** | Slot durations are multiples of `ResourceType.min_duration_minutes`; supports 15-min increments through multi-day blocks |
| **Real-Time Availability Calendar** | Atomic slot reservation with optimistic locking; live availability pushed via WebSocket or SSE |
| **Online Booking with Payment** | Coupled payment flow (confirm-on-capture) and decoupled flow (hold-then-pay) with automatic expiry |
| **Recurring Bookings** | Daily, weekly, and custom-cadence series with conflict detection and series-level management |
| **Waitlist Management** | Automatic promotion of first-eligible waitlist entry on cancellation; 30-minute confirmation window |
| **Cancellation & Refund Policies** | Configurable lead-time tiers; same-day cancellations incur penalty rate; no-shows receive zero refund |
| **Staff Scheduling & Assignment** | Assign staff to resources or specific slots; support double-booking guards per staff member |
| **Bulk / Corporate Booking** | Monthly quota enforcement for corporate accounts; excess bookings routed for corporate admin approval |
| **SMS / Email Notifications** | Confirmation, reminder (24h and 1h before), cancellation, waitlist-promotion, and no-show alerts |
| **Admin Override & Manual Booking** | Privileged API paths for front-desk and ops teams with audit trail |
| **Reporting & Occupancy Analytics** | Utilization rate, revenue, no-show rate, cancellation rate by resource, venue, and time period |

## Domain Adaptability

| Domain | Resource | Slot Window | Capacity Model |
|--------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Sports** | Tennis / Futsal Court | 30 min – 2 h | Exclusive (1 team) |
| **Healthcare** | Doctor / Examination Room | 15 – 60 min | Exclusive (1 patient) |
| **Coworking** | Meeting Room / Hot Desk | 30 min – 8 h | Exclusive or shared |
| **Beauty & Wellness** | Salon Chair / Spa Room | 30 – 90 min | Exclusive (1 client) |
| **Creative Studios** | Recording / Photo Studio | 1 – 8 h | Exclusive |
| **Education** | Classroom / Tutor | 45 – 90 min | Group (up to capacity) |
| **Parking** | Parking Bay | 30 min – 30 days | Exclusive |
| **Events** | Hall / Auditorium | Half-day / Full-day | Group (ticketed capacity) |

## Getting Started

- Review [`traceability-matrix.md`](./traceability-matrix.md) first to navigate requirement-to-implementation coverage across phases.
### For Architects
1. Read the system context: `analysis/system-context-diagram.md`
2. Review the domain model: `high-level-design/domain-model.md`
3. Understand bounded contexts: `high-level-design/c4-context-container.md`

### For Backend Engineers
1. Study the API contract: `detailed-design/api-design.md`
2. Implement the database schema: `detailed-design/erd-database-schema.md`
3. Follow business rules strictly: `analysis/business-rules.md`
4. Subscribe to domain events: `analysis/event-catalog.md`

### For Product Managers
1. Start with requirements: `requirements/requirements-document.md`
2. Review user stories: `requirements/user-stories.md`
3. Track delivery: `implementation/implementation-playbook.md`

### For QA Engineers
1. Review edge cases: `edge-cases/README.md`
2. Test booking flows: `edge-cases/booking-and-payments.md`
3. Validate business rules: `analysis/business-rules.md`
